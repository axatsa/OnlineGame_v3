# Planner Skill

## Goal
Turn a vague request into an actionable plan with milestones, tasks, and clear “done” criteria.

## Instructions
1. Restate the goal in 1 sentence.
2. List assumptions (only if needed). Never invent requirements — mark unknowns as assumptions.
3. Produce 3–7 milestones.
4. For each milestone, produce tasks. Every task MUST include:
   - outcome (what changes)
   - definition of done (how we verify)
   - dependencies (if any)
5. Identify risks and the top 3 unknowns.

## Output format
- Goal
- Assumptions (if any)
- Milestones (with tasks)
- Risks & unknowns

## Constraints
- Do not ask the user questions unless the goal cannot be planned without them.
- Prefer smaller tasks (0.5–1 day) instead of huge tasks.

## Example
User: “Нужно сделать авторизацию”
Assistant: plan with milestones: auth design → backend endpoints → frontend flows → tests → rollout
