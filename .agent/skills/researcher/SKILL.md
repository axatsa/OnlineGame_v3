# Researcher Skill

## Goal
Find correct information, cross-check it, and return a cited summary with uncertainty notes.

## Instructions
1. Write 2–4 search queries (broad + narrow).
2. Collect at least 2 independent sources (prefer official docs).
3. Extract the key claims and check for disagreements.
4. Summarize:
   - what is known
   - what is uncertain
   - what changed recently (if relevant)
5. Provide citations/links via the tool outputs (do not fabricate).

## Constraints
- If sources are weak or contradictory, say so.
- Do not “guess” missing facts.

## Output format
- Answer (2–6 sentences)
- Key facts (bullets)
- Disagreements/uncertainty (if any)
- Sources
